# My C Programming Journey

This repository is a collection of my daily C programming exercises and solutions. It serves as a personal log to track my progress and to showcase my problem-solving skills as I learn the C language.

## About the Project

Each C file in this repository is a solution to a specific programming problem. The file names are numbered to follow my learning progression. The problems cover fundamental concepts of C, including:

- **Arrays**: Storing, printing, and performing calculations on array elements.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementation of common sorting techniques like Bubble Sort and Selection Sort.
- **Number Sequences**: Generating classic sequences like the Fibonacci series.
- **Problem Solving**: Finding the second largest element, counting duplicates, and more.



## How to Compile and Run

To compile and run any of these files, you will need a C compiler like GCC.

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to the folder containing the C file.
3.  Compile the file using GCC:
    ```bash
    gcc your_file_name.c -o output_name
    ```
4.  Run the executable:
    ```bash
    ./output_name
    ```
